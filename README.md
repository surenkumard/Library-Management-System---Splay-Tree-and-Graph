# Library Management System Using Splay Tree and Graph
This project is a C++ console application designed to manage library operations efficiently by leveraging data structures such as Splay Trees and Graphs. The system facilitates book management, student records, and book issuance tracking.

**Features**
- **Book Management**: Allows administrators to create new book racks, insert books, search for books, and view recently accessed books.​

- **Student Management**: Enables adding new students and displaying all student records.​

- **Book Issuance**: Facilitates issuing books to students, tracking issued books, and processing book returns.​

- **Related Books**: Provides recommendations for books related to a specific book based on the implemented graph structure.​

**Data Structures Utilized**
- **Splay Tree**: Used to manage and access book records efficiently. Splay Trees are self-adjusting binary search trees that move frequently accessed elements closer to the root, thereby optimizing access times. ​

- **Graph**: Employed to represent relationships between books, enabling the system to suggest related books to users.
